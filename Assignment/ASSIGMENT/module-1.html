    <h3 class="text-h3">Q-1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</h3>
    <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are
        closely related.

        An HTML tag is a code that is used to define the start and end of an HTML element. For example, the tag is used
        to indicate the beginning of a paragraph, and the tag is used to indicate the end of that paragraph.

        An HTML element, on the other hand, is made up of the opening tag, the content inside the element, and the
        closing tag. For example, a paragraph element would consist of the opening tag, the text or other content of the
        paragraph, and the closing tag.</p>

    <h3 class="text-h3">Q-2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</h3>
    <p><span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; In HTML, tags and attributes are used to define the structure and
        content of a web page.

        Tags are used to create HTML elements and define their purpose and meaning. HTML tags are enclosed in angle
        brackets (<>) and are used to specify the type of element that you want to create.

            For example, the <h2> tag is used to define a heading element, and the tag is used to define a paragraph
                element.</h2>
    </p>

    <p class="text-p attributes">Attributes, on the other hand, are used to provide additional information about an HTML
        element. Attributes are added to the opening tag of an HTML element and are used to modify the element's
        behavior or appearance.

        For example, the src attribute is used to specify the source of an image element, and the href attribute is used
        to specify the URL of a hyperlink element.

        Here's an example of an image element with a src attribute:

        <img src="" alt="">
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-h3">Q-3. What are void elements in HTML?</h3>
    <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; Void elements, also known as empty elements or self-closing elements, are HTML
        elements that do not have a closing tag. Here are some examples of void elements in HTML:<br>

        <img> Used to display images on a web page.
        <!-- Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful landscape" /> --> <br>

        input:- Used to create input fields, such as text boxes or checkboxes.
        Example: <input type="text" name="username" /><br>

        <br> Used to insert a line break or carriage return.
        <br> Example: This is the first line.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the
        second line.<br><br>

        Void elements are written with a slash before the closing angle bracket to indicate that they do not have a
        closing tag. While the closing slash is optional in HTML5, it is still recommended to include it for
        compatibility with older browsers and versions of HTML.

    <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-4. What are HTML Entities?</h3>
    <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp;HTML entities are special codes that are used to represent characters that cannot be
        typed using the keyboard or that have special meaning in HTML. HTML entities are written using a special syntax
        that starts with an ampersand (&) and ends with a semicolon (;).

        For example, the HTML entity &lt; represents the less-than symbol (<), while &gt; represents the greater-than
            symbol (>).

            HTML entities are commonly used to display special characters, such as copyright symbols (©), registered
            trademarks (®), or mathematical symbols (Σ).

            Here are a few examples of HTML entities: <br>

            &copy;: Copyright symbol (©) <br>
            &reg;: Registered trademark symbol (®) <br>
            &euro;: Euro currency symbol (€) <br>
            &nbsp; nbsp: Non-breaking space</p>

    <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-5. What are different types of lists in HTML?</h3>
    <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp;In HTML, there are three types of lists that can be used to organize and structure
        content on a web page: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.

        Ordered lists (ol): Ordered lists are used to create lists of items that have a specific order or sequence. Each
        item in an ordered list is preceded by a number or letter.
        Example:

    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>
    Unordered lists (ul): Unordered lists are used to create lists of items that do not have a specific order or
    sequence. Each item in an unordered list is preceded by a bullet point.
    Example:

    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>
    Definition lists (dl): Definition lists are used to create lists of terms and their definitions. Each term is
    defined using a definition element (dt), and each definition is provided using a description element (dd).
    Example:

    <dl>
        <dt>Term 1</dt>
        <dd>Definition of term 1</dd>
        <dt>Term 2</dt>
        <dd>Definition of term 2</dd>
        <dt>Term 3</dt>
        <dd>Definition of term 3</dd>
    </dl>
    By using these list types, you can effectively organize and structure your content to make it more readable and
    accessible for your website visitors.</p>

    <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?</h3>
    <p class="text-p"> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp;The class attribute is an HTML attribute that is used to assign one or more classes to an HTML
        element. Classes are used to group elements together based on common characteristics, such as their appearance,
        behavior, or functionality.The class attribute can be used on any HTML element, including headings, paragraphs,
        links, images, and more. By using classes, you can easily apply consistent styles to multiple elements on your
        web page, without having to write separate CSS rules for each individual element.</p>

    <h3 class="text-h3">  Q-7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
        elements?</h3>
    <p id="text-id"> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp;The id attribute and the class attribute are both used to assign a name to an HTML element, but they
        serve different purposes and have different rules.

        The id attribute is used to uniquely identify an element on a web page. Each id attribute value must be unique
        within the page, and can only be used once per element. This means that if you use the same id attribute value
        on multiple elements, it will be invalid HTML. The id attribute is often used to target specific elements with
        CSS or JavaScript.</p>
    <p class="text-c">On the other hand, the class attribute is used to group elements together based on common
        characteristics, such as their appearance, behavior, or functionality. Multiple elements can have the same class
        attribute value, and an element can have multiple classes assigned to it by separating the class names with a
        space. This allows for greater flexibility in styling and organizing elements on a web page.</p>

    <h3 class="text-h3">  Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h3>
    <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp;HTML provides various formatting tags to style the text and structure of a web page. Here are some of the most
        commonly used formatting tags in HTML, along with examples of how they can be used:

    <h1> to <h6> These tags are used to create headings of different sizes, with <h1> being the largest and <h6> being
                    the smallest. Example: <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

                    <p> This tag is used to create paragraphs of text. Example:
                    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

                    <em> This tag is used to emphasize text, usually by making it italicized.</em> Example: This is
                    <em>important</em> information.</p>

                    <strong> This tag is used to make text stand out, usually by making it bold. Example: <p>
                            <strong>Warning:</strong> Do not attempt this at home.
                        </p>

                        <a> This tag is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources. Example: <a
                                href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a>

                            ul and ol These tags are used to create unordered and ordered lists, respectively. Example:

                            <ul>
                                <li>Item 1</li>
                                <li>Item 2</li>
                                <li>Item 3</li>
                            </ul>

                            <ol>
                                <li>First</li>
                                <li>Second</li>
                                <li>Third</li>
                            </ol>
                            <br> This tag is used to create line breaks within a block of text. Example: <p>This is the
                                first line.<br>This is the second line.</p>

                            These are just a few examples of the many formatting tags available in HTML. By using these
                            tags, web developers can structure their content and style their web pages to create
                            visually appealing and user-friendly websites.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; Cell padding and cell spacing are both used to create space between cells in an HTML
                                table, but they function in different ways: <br><br>

                                Cell Padding: Cell padding is used to add space within a cell of an HTML table, between
                                the cell content and the cell border. This can be used to create some breathing room
                                around the content within a cell. The cell padding value is specified using the
                                "cellpadding" attribute in the <table> tag. Example:

                                    <table cellpadding="10">
                                        <tr>
                                            <td>Cell 1</td>
                                            <td>Cell 2</td>
                                        </tr>
                                        <tr>
                                            <td>Cell 3</td>
                                            <td>Cell 4</td>
                                        </tr>
                                    </table>
                                    In this example, the cellpadding attribute is set to 10, so there will be 10 pixels
                                    of padding between the cell content and the cell border. <br><br>

                                    Cell Spacing: Cell spacing is used to create space between cells in an HTML table.
                                    This can be used to make the table easier to read and navigate, by adding space
                                    between cells to make it clear where one cell ends and another begins. The cell
                                    spacing value is specified using the "cellspacing" attribute in the <table> tag.
                                        Example:

                                        <table cellspacing="5">
                                            <tr>
                                                <td>Cell 1</td>
                                                <td>Cell 2</td>
                                            </tr>
                                            <tr>
                                                <td>Cell 3</td>
                                                <td>Cell 4</td>
                                            </tr>
                                        </table>
                                        In this example, the cellspacing attribute is set to 5, so there will be 5
                                        pixels of space between each cell in the table.

                                        In summary, cell padding is used to add space within a cell, while cell spacing
                                        is used to add space between cells in an HTML table.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or
                                column in an HTML table?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; In HTML, we can use the rowspan and colspan attributes to combine multiple rows or
                                columns into a single row or column. <br><br>

                                To combine two or more rows into a single row, we can use the rowspan attribute. The
                                value of the rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows that the cell should span.
                                <br><br>

                                Here is an example:

                                <table>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td rowspan="2">Row 1 Cell 1</td>
                                        <td>Row 1 Cell 2</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Row 2 Cell 2</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Row 3 Cell 1</td>
                                        <td>Row 3 Cell 2</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </table>
                                In this example, the first cell in the first row spans two rows using rowspan="2". This
                                means that it takes up the space of two cells in the second row. <br><br>

                                To combine two or more columns into a single column, we can use the colspan attribute.
                                The value of the colspan attribute specifies the number of columns that the cell should
                                span. <br><br>

                                Here is an example:

                                <table>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Row 1 Cell 1</td>
                                        <td colspan="2">Row 1 Cell 2 and 3</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Row 2 Cell 1</td>
                                        <td>Row 2 Cell 2</td>
                                        <td>Row 2 Cell 3</td>
                                    </tr>
                                    <tr>
                                        <td>Row 3 Cell 1</td>
                                        <td>Row 3 Cell 2</td>
                                        <td>Row 3 Cell 3</td>
                                    </tr>
                                </table>
                                In this example, the second cell in the first row spans two columns using colspan="2".
                                This means that it takes up the space of two cells in the same row.

                            <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an
                                inline element? </h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; A block-level element starts on a new line and takes up the full width available, and it
                                also has a vertical space between it and the elements above and below it. Block-level
                                elements are typically used to create larger structural sections of a web page, such as
                                headers, paragraphs, lists, and divisions.

                                Examples of block-level elements include:

                                <p> (paragraph)</p>
                                <div> (division)</div>
                                <h1> headings <h6> (headings) </h6>
                                    <ul> and <ol> (unordered and ordered lists) <br><br></ol>
                                    </ul>
                                    <form> (form) <br><br></form>
                                    An inline element, on the other hand, does not start on a new line and only takes up
                                    as much width as necessary. It does not create any vertical space between itself and
                                    adjacent elements. Inline elements are typically used to apply styles to specific
                                    parts of a text, such as emphasizing a word, linking to another page, or styling a
                                    code snippet.

                                    Examples of inline elements include:

                                    <a> (anchor) <br><br></a>
                                    <strong> and <em> (bold and italic) <br><br></em></strong>
                                    <span> (generic inline container) <br><br></span>
                                    <code> (inline code) <br><br></code>
                                    Here's an example of how block-level and inline elements behave differently:

                                    <!DOCTYPE html>
                                    <html>

                                    <head>
                                        <title>Block-level vs Inline Elements</title>
                                        <style>

                                                font-size: 20px;
                                            }

                                            .inline {
                                                background-color: lightgreen;
                                                padding: 5px;
                                                font-size: 20px;
                                            }
                                        </style>
                                    </head>

                                    <body>
                                        <div class="block">
                                            This is a block-level element. It starts on a new line and takes up the full
                                            width available.
                                        </div>
                                        <span class="inline">This is an inline element. It only takes up as much width
                                            as necessary.</span>
                                        <div class="block">
                                            Another block-level element.

                                    </html>
                                    In this example, the first and third (div) elements are block-level elements, while
                                    the (span) element is an inline element. The block-level elements are displayed as
                                    separate paragraphs with a line break between them, while the inline element is
                                    displayed inline with the surrounding text. The block-level elements also have a
                                    larger background color and padding applied to them.

                            <h3 class="text-h3"> Q-12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; In HTML, you can create a hyperlink using the anchor element <a>. An anchor element
                                    creates a link to another webpage or a specific location within the current webpage.
                                    Here is an example of how to create a hyperlink in HTML:

                                    <!DOCTYPE html>
                                    <html>

                                    <head>
                                        <title>My Webpage</title>
                                    </head>

                                    <body>
                                        <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
                                        <p>Check out my <a href="file:///D:/html%20practice/convertio-2/index.html"
                                                target="_blank">Convertio</a>.</p>
                                    </body>

                                    </html>
                                    In this example, we have an <a> element with an href attribute that specifies the
                                        URL of the page we want to link to. In this case, the URL is
                                        "https://www.example.com". The text "favorite website" between the opening and
                                        closing <a> tags is what the user will click on to follow the link. When the
                                            user clicks on the link, they will be taken to the URL specified in the href
                                            attribute.

                                            Note that the text between the <a> tags can be any text or HTML element,
                                                such as an image or a button. The href attribute can also be a relative
                                                URL, which links to a page or file within the same website. For example,
                                                if we wanted to link to a file called "about.html" in the same directory
                                                as our current HTML file, we could use a relative URL like this:


                                                <a href="file:///D:/html%20practice/foods/index.html"
                                                    target="_blank">Food Websit</a>
                                                This would create a hyperlink that takes the user to the "about.html"
                                                file in the same directory when they click on the "About Me" text.

                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-13. What is the use of an iframe tag?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; The (iframe) tag in HTML is used to embed another HTML document or web page within the
                                current document. This can be useful for displaying content from another website or for
                                dividing a single webpage into multiple sections.

                                Here's an example of how to use the (iframe) tag:

                                <!DOCTYPE html>
                                <html>

                                    <h1>Welcome to my webpage!</h1>
                                    <p>Here is an embedded YouTube video:</p>

                                </body>

                                </html> <br><br>
                                In this example, we have an (iframe) element that contains an embedded YouTube video.
                                The src attribute specifies the URL of the video to be embedded, and the width and
                                height attributes determine the size of the video player. The frameborder attribute
                                specifies whether or not the iframe should have a border, and the allowfullscreen
                                attribute allows the video to be viewed in full-screen mode.

                                The content within the (iframe) tag is displayed within a separate rectangular area on
                                the webpage, called an "inline frame". The content within the iframe can be styled and
                                manipulated just like any other HTML document. It is also possible to communicate
                                between the parent document and the embedded document using JavaScript.

                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-14.What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; The <span> tag is an inline HTML element used to apply styles and formatting to a
                                    specific section of text within a larger block of content. It is often used to group
                                    a few words or a small section of text together, so that they can be styled or
                                    manipulated as a unit.

                                    Here is an example of how the <span> tag can be used:

                                        <p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red</span> apple.</p>
                                        In this example, the word "red" is wrapped in a <span> tag with a style
                                            attribute that sets the color of the text to red. The result is that only
                                            the word "red" is displayed in red, while the rest of the text remains
                                            black.

                                            You can also use CSS to style the <span> tag. For example, you could define
                                                a CSS class like this:

                                                .red {
                                                color: red;
                                                }
                                                And then use it to style the <span> tag like this:

                                                    <p>This is a <span class="red">red</span> apple.</p>
                                                    This has the same effect as the previous example, but the styling is
                                                    defined in a separate CSS file or in a (style) element in the head
                                                    of the document. Using CSS classes instead of inline styles is
                                                    generally considered to be better practice because it separates the
                                                    presentation of the content from the structure of the document.</p>

                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; To insert a picture into a background image of a web page, you can use CSS to set the

                                In this example, the (div) element with the class "container" is used to set the
                                background image for the page. The background-image property is used to specify the URL
                                of the background image. The background-size property is used to set the size of the
                                background image to cover the entire container element, and the background-position
                                property is used to center the image.

                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-16. How are active links different from normal links? </h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; Active links and normal links are different in terms of their appearance and behavior
                                when they are clicked.

                                A normal link is a hyperlink that is displayed in a different color (usually blue) and
                                is underlined by default. When a user clicks on a normal link, it typically navigates to
                                a different web page or section within the same page.

                                An active link, on the other hand, is a hyperlink that has been clicked but has not yet
                                finished loading the new page or section. When a user clicks on an active link, the link
                                is temporarily highlighted in a different color (usually a lighter shade of the link
                                color) to indicate that it is currently active and being processed. <br><br>

                                Here is an example of what an active link might look like: <br><br>

                                <a href="http://google.com" class="active">Click here</a> <br><br>
                                In this example, the <a> element is a hyperlink that points to the URL
                                    "http://google.com". The class="active" attribute is used to apply a CSS class to
                                    the link that defines its appearance when it is active.

                                    In this example, the "active" class sets the color of the text to red, underlines
                                    the link, and sets the background color to a light yellow to indicate that it is
                                    currently active.

                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-17. What are the different tags to separate sections of text? </h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; There are several HTML tags that can be used to separate sections of text within a web
                                page. Here are some examples:

                                <h1> to <h6></h6> These tags are used to create headings of different levels of
                                    importance. They are typically used to break up a page into sections and provide a
                                    hierarchy of information. For example: <br><br>

                                    <h1>Main Heading</h1>
                                    <p>This is the main content of the page.</p>

                                    <h2>Subheading 1</h2>
                                    <p>This is some additional information.</p>

                                    <h3>Subheading 2</h3>
                                    <p>This is even more information.</p>
                                    <p> This tag is used to separate paragraphs of text. It is often used to break up
                                        large blocks of text into more manageable sections. For example: <br>

                                    <p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
                                    <p>This is the second paragraph.</p>
                                    <p>This is the third paragraph.</p>
                                    <hr> This tag is used to create a horizontal line that separates content. It is
                                    often used to break up a page into sections or to visually separate different types
                                    of content. For example: <br><br>

                                    <p>This is some text.</p>
                                    <p>This is some more text.</p>
                                    <br>This tag is used to create a line break within a paragraph of text. It is often
                                    used to create space between lines of text or to separate content that is displayed
                                    on the same line. For example: <br>

                                    <p>This is the first line.
                                        This is the second line.</p>
                                    (div) This tag is used to create a container for a section of content. It is often
                                    used to group related content together and apply styles or formatting to the entire
                                    group. For example:

                                    <div>
                                        <h2>Heading</h2>
                                        <p>This is some text.</p>
                                        <p>This is some more text.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    These are just a few examples of the many HTML tags that can be used to separate
                                    sections of text on a web page. The choice of tag depends on the specific needs of
                                    the content and the desired layout of the page.

                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector image format used to display
                                images and graphics on the web that can be scaled up or down without losing quality. SVG
                                images are based on XML, which means they can be created and edited with a text editor
                                or a vector graphics editor.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-19. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are
                                both markup languages used to create web pages. However, there are some key differences
                                between the two. <br><br>

                                The main difference between HTML and XHTML is that XHTML is a stricter, more
                                standardized version of HTML that is based on XML. Here are some examples of the
                                differences between the two: <br><br>

                                Syntax: XHTML has a stricter syntax than HTML. For example, all elements must be
                                properly nested and closed, and all attributes must be in quotes. In HTML, some of these
                                rules can be relaxed or ignored. Here is an example of an HTML unordered list:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Item 1</li>
                                    <li>Item 2</li>
                                    <li>Item 3</li>
                                </ul>
                                Here is the same list in XHTML:

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Item 1</li>
                                    <li>Item 2</li>
                                    <li>Item 3</li>
                                </ul>
                                Note that in XHTML, all elements must be closed with a closing tag, and all attribute
                                values must be in quotes. <br><br>

                                Case sensitivity: XHTML is case-sensitive, meaning that all elements and attributes must
                                be written in lowercase. HTML, on the other hand, is case-insensitive, meaning that it
                                doesn't matter whether you write elements and attributes in uppercase or lowercase. Here
                                is an example of an HTML image tag:

                            </p>
                            <hr>
                            <hr>




                            <h3 class="text-h3">Q-20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML? </h3>
                            <p> <span> ANS:- </span> &nbsp; In HTML, there are two types of tags: logical tags and physical tags. <br><br>

                                Logical tags: Logical tags are also known as semantic tags. They describe the meaning of
                                the content they enclose, rather than its appearance. Logical tags help search engines
                                and screen readers to understand the content of a web page, and make it more accessible
                                to users. Here are some examples of logical tags:

                                <header>HELLO</header> - defines a header for a document or section
                                <nav>HELLO</nav> - defines a set of navigation links
                                <main>HELLO</main> - defines the main content of a document
                                <article>HELLO</article> - defines an article or blog post
                                <aside>HELLO</aside> - defines content aside from the main content
                                <footer>HELLO</footer> - defines a footer for a document or section <br><br>

                                Physical tags: Physical tags, also known as presentational tags, define the appearance
                                of the content they enclose. Physical tags are used to apply formatting, such as font
                                size, color, or alignment, to text and other elements. Here are some examples of
                                physical tags: <br><br>

                                <b>HELLO</b> - bold text <br>
                                <i>HELLO</i> - italicized text <br>
                                <u>HELLO</u> - underlined text <br>
                                <s>HELLO</s> - strikethrough text <br>
                                <font>HELLO</font> - defines font family, size, and color <br>
                                <table>HELLO</table> - defines a table <br>
                                <div>HELLO</div> - defines a container for other elements <br>
                                <span>HELLO</span> - defines a small section of text <br>
                                It's important to note that while physical tags are still supported in HTML, they are
                                considered outdated and should be avoided in favor of logical tags and Cascading Style
                                Sheets (CSS) for styling and layout. Logical tags provide a more meaningful structure to
                                the content and allow for better accessibility and search engine optimization. CSS
                                separates the presentation from the content, making it easier to update the design of a
                                web page without changing its HTML structure.
