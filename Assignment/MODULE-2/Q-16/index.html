    <h3 class="text-h3">Q-16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h3>

    <p>ANS:- &nbsp; Advantages of using external style sheets:- <br><br>

        1. Reusability: External style sheets allow you to define styles in a separate file and apply them to multiple
        HTML documents.<br>

        2. Separation of concerns: External style sheets promote separation of concerns by separating the presentation
        (CSS) from the content (HTML). <br><br>

        Disadvantages of using external style sheets:- <br><br>

        1. Increased HTTP requests: Since external style sheets require an additional HTTP request to download the CSS
        file, this can increase the load time of your page, especially if you have multiple external style sheets.
        <br>

        2. Possible conflicts: If multiple external style sheets are used on a single page, there is a risk of
        conflicting styles that can lead to unexpected results.
