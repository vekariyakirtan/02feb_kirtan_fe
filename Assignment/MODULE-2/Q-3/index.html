    <p>ANS:- &nbsp; CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to describe the visual presentation of a web page.
        CSS2 and CSS3 are two different versions of this language, with CSS3 being the more recent and advanced version.
        Here are some of the main differences between CSS2 and CSS3: <br><br>

        1. Selectors:- CSS3 introduces new selectors that allow for more specific targeting of elements on a web page.
        For example, CSS3 introduces the :nth-child() selector, which allows you to select elements based on their
        position within a parent element.<br><br>

        2. Box Model:- CSS3 includes new properties and values that allow for more precise control over the layout of
        elements on a web page. For example, CSS3 introduces the box-sizing property, which allows you to specify
        whether an element's border and padding should be included in its overall size.<br><br>

        3. Media Queries:- CSS3 introduces media queries, which allow you to specify different styles for different
        devices or screen sizes. This makes it easier to create responsive designs that adapt to different viewing
        contexts.<br><br></p><hr><hr>
