Q-1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?

Ans.No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing, although they are related concepts.

An HTML tag is a code that starts with the "<" symbol, followed by the name of the tag and ends with the ">" symbol.
    Tags are used to create an HTML element, which defines the structure and content of a web page. For example,
    the "<p>" tag is used to create a paragraph element, the "<img>" tag is used to create an image element, and so on.
    An HTML element, on the other hand, is made up of the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag. The opening tag
    defines the element, while the closing tag indicates the end of the element. The content of the element is the
    information that is displayed on the web page. For example, a paragraph element would be made up of the
    opening "<p>" tag, the text content, and the closing "</p>" tag. So while tags are used to create elements, they are
    not the same thing as the elements themselves.

    Q-2. What are tags and attributes in  HTML?

    Tags and attributes are two fundamental concepts in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is used to create
    web pages. Tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. They are enclosed in angle brackets (<>)
    and come in pairs, with the opening tag and closing tag wrapping around the content they are defining. For example,
    the <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text:

    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    Attributes provide additional information about a tag and are placed inside the opening tag. Attributes have a name
    and a value, separated by an equals sign. The most common attributes are the "id" and "class" attributes, which are
    used to identify and style HTML elements with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

    Q-3. What are void elements in HTML?

    In HTML, void elements are those elements that do not require a closing tag because they do not have any content.
    Void elements are self-closing, which means they are closed with a forward slash (/) immediately before the closing
    angle bracket (>).

    Void elements are used for inserting images, line breaks, inputs, and other elements that do not have content. Some
    examples of void elements in HTML are:

    This is because the HTML5 specification allows void elements to be written without the closing slash as long as they
    appear in the "void elements" list.

    *******************************************************************************

    Q-4. What are HTML Entities?

    HTML Entities are special codes used in HTML to display characters that are reserved for HTML markup, but still need
    to be displayed as text on a web page. These characters include symbols, mathematical operators, foreign language
    characters, and other special characters that have a reserved meaning in HTML.

    HTML Entities are written using an ampersand (&), followed by a code or name, and then a semicolon (;). The code or
    name represents the character that needs to be displayed. For example, the HTML Entity for the copyright symbol (©)
    is ©, and the HTML Entity for the euro sign (€) is €.

    Some commonly used HTML Entities include:

    < for the less-than sign (<)> for the greater-than sign (>)
        & for the ampersand (&)
        for a non-breaking space
        © for the copyright symbol (©)
        ® for the registered trademark symbol (®)
        ™ for the trademark symbol (™)
        HTML Entities are useful for displaying special characters that may not be available on all keyboards or for
        displaying characters that have a special meaning in HTML.

        Q-5. What are different types of lists in HTML?

        There are three types of lists in HTML:

        Ordered lists (ol): An ordered list is a list of items that are numbered in a specific order. Each list item is marked with a number, usually starting with 1. Ordered lists are created using the <ol> tag and list items are created using the <li> tag. Here is an example:

        <ol>
          <li>First item</li>
          <li>Second item</li>
          <li>Third item</li>
        </ol>
        Unordered lists (ul): An unordered list is a list of items that are marked with bullets or other special characters, without any particular order. Unordered lists are created using the <ul> tag and list items are created using the <li> tag. Here is an example:

        <ul>
          <li>First item</li>
          <li>Second item</li>
          <li>Third item</li>
        </ul>
        Definition lists (dl): A definition list is a list of terms and their definitions. Each term is defined by one or more definitions. Definition lists are created using the <dl> tag, term or definition are created using the <dt> and <dd> tag respectively. Here is an example:

        <dl>
          <dt>Term 1</dt>
          <dd>Definition 1</dd>
          <dt>Term 2</dt>
          <dd>Definition 2</dd>
          <dt>Term 3</dt>
          <dd>Definition 3</dd>
        </dl>
        In this example, each term is defined by its corresponding definition. The <dt> tag is used to define the term, and the <dd> tag is used to define the definition.

     Q-6.  What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?

        The class attribute is used in HTML to specify one or more classes for an HTML element. Classes can be used to group similar elements together and apply CSS styles to them.

        For example, consider the following HTML code:

        <p class="intro">This is a paragraph.</p>
        In this example, the class attribute is used to assign the class name "intro" to the <p> element. This class can then be used in a CSS stylesheet to apply specific styles to all elements with the "intro" class.

        Multiple classes can be assigned to an element by separating them with a space, like this:

        <p class="intro highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
        In this example, the class attribute assigns two classes to the <p> element, "intro" and "highlight". Both classes can be used in a CSS stylesheet to apply specific styles to elements with either class.

                        Q-7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
                        elements?

                        The main difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute of HTML elements is
                        that the 'id' attribute specifies a unique identifier for an HTML element, while the 'class'
                        attribute specifies a non-unique class or group of elements.

                        The 'id' attribute is used to uniquely identify an HTML element on a web page. An 'id' attribute
                        value must be unique within the entire document, meaning that no two elements can have the same
                        'id' value. The 'id' attribute is often used to create anchor links within a document, to apply
                        unique styles to a specific element, or to manipulate an element with JavaScript.

                        On the other hand, the 'class' attribute is used to group elements together based on a shared
                        attribute or characteristic. Multiple elements can have the same 'class' attribute value, and
                        elements can belong to multiple classes. The 'class' attribute is commonly used to apply CSS
                        styles to groups of elements or to manipulate groups of elements with JavaScript.

                        Here is an example of using the 'id' and 'class' attributes in HTML:

                        <p id="first-paragraph" class="important">This is the first paragraph.</p>
                        <p class="important">This is another important paragraph.</p>

                        In this example, the first paragraph has a unique 'id' value of "first-paragraph", which can be
                        used to manipulate the element with JavaScript or create an anchor link. Both paragraphs also
                        belong to the "important" class, which can be used to apply a shared style or manipulate both
                        elements with JavaScript.

                        Q-8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

                        HTML includes a variety of formatting tags that can be used to style text, apply emphasis,
                        create headings, and more. Some of the most commonly used formatting tags in HTML include:

                        <b> - Used to make text bold.
                            <i> - Used to make text italic.
                                <u> - Used to underline text.
                                    <strong> - Used to indicate strong emphasis (similar to <b> but with semantic
                                            meaning).
                                            <em> - Used to indicate emphasis (similar to <i> but with semantic meaning).
                                                    <h1> to <h6> - Used to create headings of various levels, with <h1>
                                                                being the most important and <h6> being the least
                                                                    important.
                                                                    <p> - Used to create paragraphs of text.
                                                                        <br> - Used to create a line break (i.e., a new
                                                                        line of text) within a paragraph.
                                                                        <hr> - Used to create a horizontal line (i.e., a
                                                                        divider) between sections of a page.
                                                                    <blockquote> - Used to indicate a block of quoted
                                                                        text.
                                                                        <pre> - Used to display pre-formatted text (such as code) with whitespace preserved.
    In addition to these basic formatting tags, HTML also includes a variety of tags for creating lists, tables, forms, and other more complex structures.

    Q-9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

    Cell padding and cell spacing are two properties used in HTML to control the spacing and layout of tables.

    Cell padding refers to the amount of space between the content of a table cell and its border. When cell padding is set to a non-zero value, there will be extra space between the content of the cell and the cell's border. Cell padding can be set using the cellpadding attribute in the table tag, or with CSS.

    In summary, cell padding controls the space between the content of a table cell and its border, while cell spacing controls the space between adjacent cells in a table. It's worth noting that both cell padding and cell spacing can be set to zero (or omitted entirely) if no extra spacing is desired.

    Q-10. How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an 
    HTML table?

    To merge two or more rows into a single row or two or more columns into a single column in an HTML table, we can use the rowspan and colspan attributes.

    The rowspan attribute is used to merge two or more rows into a single row. To use rowspan, we need to set the attribute to the number of rows that we want to merge. For example, if we want to merge two rows, we would set rowspan="2" on the first cell of the first row.

    Here's an example of using rowspan to merge two rows:

    <table>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Merged Row 1</td>
        <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    In this example, the first cell of the first row has rowspan="2", which means that it will span two rows. As a result, the "Merged Row 1" cell will take up the space of both the first and second rows.

    The colspan attribute is used to merge two or more columns into a single column. To use colspan, we need to set the attribute to the number of columns that we want to merge. For example, if we want to merge two columns, we would set colspan="2" on the first cell of the first column.

    Here's an example of using colspan to merge two columns:

    <table>
    <tr>
        <td>Column 1</td>
        <td colspan="2">Merged Columns 2 and 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
        <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
        <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    In this example, the first cell of the second row has colspan="2", which means that it will span two columns. As a result, the "Merged Columns 2 and 3" cell will take up the space of both the second and third columns.

    Q-11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element? 

    In HTML and CSS, elements can be classified as either block-level or inline. The main difference between these two types of elements is how they are displayed on a web page and how they interact with other elements.

    A block-level element takes up the entire width of its parent container and creates a new line after it. This means that any content that comes after a block-level element will be pushed to a new line. Block-level elements include headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), divs, and lists (ul, ol). Block-level elements are used for larger structural pieces of content on a web page.

    An inline element, on the other hand, does not create a new line after it and only takes up as much width as necessary to display its content. This means that multiple inline elements can appear on the same line. Inline elements include links (a), images (img), and spans. Inline elements are often used for smaller pieces of content within a block-level element, such as text or icons.

    Q-12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?

    To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the anchor tag (<a>). Here's an example:

        <a href="https://www.example.com">Link Text</a>
        The href attribute specifies the URL that the hyperlink points to. In this case, it's set to https://www.example.com.
        
        The text that appears on the webpage as the link is called the link text. In this example, it's set to "Link Text".
        
        When the user clicks on the link, the browser will load the URL specified in the href attribute.
        
        You can also create a link that points to another page on your own website by specifying a relative URL instead of an absolute URL:
        
        <a href="page2.html">Link Text</a>
        This will create a hyperlink to a file named "page2.html" in the same directory as the current HTML file.
        
        You can also add additional attributes to the <a> tag to control how the link behaves, such as target to specify whether the link should open in a new tab or window, and title to add a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. Here's an example:
        
        <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" title="Go to Example">Link Text</a>
        In this example, the target attribute is set to _blank to open the link in a new tab or window, and the title attribute is set to "Go to Example" to display a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.

    Q-13. What is the use of an iframe tag?

    The iframe (short for inline frame) tag in HTML is used to embed another HTML document inside the current document. It allows you to display content from a different source on your web page without having to navigate away from the current page.

    The syntax for an iframe tag is as follows:

    <iframe src="URL of the page to be displayed" width="width in pixels" height="height in pixels" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to be displayed inside the iframe. The width and height attributes specify the size of the iframe in pixels. The frameborder attribute controls whether or not a border is displayed around the iframe.

    When a user visits a web page that contains an iframe tag, the browser will load the content of the specified URL and display it inside the iframe. This allows you to embed content from another website, such as a video, map, or social media feed, within your own web page.

    *******************************************************************************

    Q-14.  What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?

    The <span> tag is an inline HTML element used to apply styling and formatting to small sections of text within a larger document. It is often used to target a specific piece of content and apply CSS styles or JavaScript functions to it, without affecting the layout or style of the surrounding content.

    example of using the <span> tag is to add a class to a specific text element and style it with CSS:

     <p>This is a <span class="highlight">highlighted</span> word.</p>
            
    <style>
    .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
    font-weight: bold;
    }
    </style>
            In this example, the word "highlighted" is wrapped in a <span> tag with a class attribute of "highlight". This allows you to target this specific element in your CSS and style it with a yellow background color and bold font-weight. This will result in the word "highlighted" being displayed with a yellow background and bold font, while the rest of the text remains unchanged.
            
            Overall, the <span> tag is a powerful tool for targeting specific pieces of content within a larger document and applying styles or functionality to them.

    Q-15. How to insert a picture into a background image of a web page? 

    To insert a picture into the background image of a web page, you can use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Here are the steps to do this:

    First, you need to have an image that you want to use as the background image. Save the image in a folder on your computer.

    Next, create a new CSS file or open an existing one. To create a new CSS file, you can use any text editor, such as Notepad or Sublime Text.

    In the CSS file, you can use the background-image property to set the background image. Here's an example:

    body {
    background-image: url('path/to/image.jpg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: cover;
    }
    In this example, we set the background image of the body element to path/to/image.jpg, which is the path to the image file on your computer. The background-repeat property is set to no-repeat to prevent the image from repeating, and the background-size property is set to cover to make the image cover the entire background.

    Save the CSS file with a .css extension, and link it to your HTML file using the <link> tag. Here's an example:

    <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/style.css">
    </head>
    In this example, we link the CSS file to the HTML file using the href attribute of the <link> tag.

    Finally, add the HTML code for the picture that you want to insert. You can use the <img> tag to insert the picture. Here's an example:

    <body>
    <img src="path/to/picture.jpg" alt="Picture">
    </body>
    In this example, we insert the picture using the <img> tag, with the src attribute set to the path of the picture file on your computer, and the alt attribute set to a description of the picture.

    The picture will appear on top of the background image, but you can use CSS to position it anywhere you want. For example, you can use the position and top properties to position the picture at the top of the page:

    img {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    }
    In this example, we set the position property to absolute, which allows us to position the picture anywhere on the page using the top, left, bottom, and right properties. We set the top property to 0, which positions the picture at the top of the page.

    Q-16. How are active links different from normal links? 

    Active links are different from normal links in that they represent a link that is currently being interacted with by the user. This could be a link that the user is hovering over with their mouse or a link that the user has clicked on and is currently being directed to.

    Normal links, on the other hand, represent links that are not currently being interacted with by the user. They are typically displayed with an underline and a default color, and when the user hovers over them, the color may change or the underline may become thicker.

    Active links can be styled differently from normal links using CSS. For example, you can change the color, font, and background of an active link to indicate to the user that they are currently interacting with it. This can help to improve the user experience by making it easier for the user to identify which links they have already clicked on or are about to click on.

    Here's an example of how to style active links using CSS:

    a:link {
    color: blue;
    }

    a:visited {
    color: purple;
    }

    a:hover {
    color: red;
    }

    a:active {
    color: green;
    }

    Q-17. What are the different tags to separate sections of text?

    There are several tags that can be used to separate sections of text, depending on the markup language or document format being used. Here are some examples:

    HTML: In HTML, you can use the following tags to separate sections of text:
    <h1> through <h6> for headings of different levels
    <p> for paragraphs of text
    <div> for larger sections of content
    <section> for grouping related content together
    <article> for standalone content, such as a blog post or news article
    <aside> for content that is related but not directly part of the main content
    Markdown: In Markdown, you can use the following symbols to separate sections of text:
    for headings of different levels (one to six hash symbols)
    --- or *** to create a horizontal rule between sections
    to create a blockquote for a section of text

    or - to create a bulleted list
    to create a numbered list
    LaTeX: In LaTeX, you can use the following commands to separate sections of text:
    \section{} for sections
    \subsection{} for subsections
    \subsubsection{} for sub-subsections
    \paragraph{} for paragraphs of text
    \subparagraph{} for sub-paragraphs of text
    These are just a few examples of the tags and commands that can be used to separate sections of text in different markup languages and document formats.

    Q-18. What is SVG?

    SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector image format that is used to display images and graphics on the web. Unlike bitmap images such as JPEGs or PNGs, which are made up of a fixed number of pixels, SVG images are based on mathematical equations, which means they can be scaled to any size without losing quality.

    SVG images are created using XML markup language, which allows them to be easily edited and manipulated. They can be created using a variety of tools, including Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, and Sketch.

    SVG images are commonly used for icons, logos, and other graphics that need to be scalable, as well as for animations and interactive graphics. They can be embedded directly into HTML code using the <svg> tag, or included as external files using the <img> tag. They can also be animated using CSS or JavaScript.

    Q-19. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used for creating web pages. While they share many similarities, there are a few key differences between the two:

    Syntax: The syntax of XHTML is stricter than HTML. XHTML requires all tags to be properly closed and all attributes to be quoted. In HTML, some tags can be left unclosed and attributes don't always need to be quoted.

    Document structure: XHTML requires a document to be well-formed XML, which means that it must have a root element, all elements must be properly nested, and all attributes must have values. HTML, on the other hand, has a looser document structure and doesn't require these strict XML rules.

    Compatibility: XHTML is designed to be compatible with XML tools and technologies, which means that it can be easily integrated with other XML-based applications. HTML, on the other hand, is not as easily integrated with other XML-based applications.

    Browser support: Some older web browsers may not fully support XHTML, whereas HTML is widely supported by all browsers.

    Overall, XHTML is seen as a more structured and strict version of HTML, while HTML is a more flexible and forgiving language. However, HTML5 has largely replaced XHTML as the preferred markup language for web pages.

    Q-20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML? 

    In HTML, tags are used to define the structure and content of web pages. There are two types of tags in HTML: logical tags and physical tags.

    Logical tags, also known as semantic tags, are used to define the meaning of content on a web page. They describe the type of content that is contained within them. Examples of logical tags in HTML5 include <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. These tags help search engines and other tools to understand the structure and content of a web page, which can be useful for search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility.

    Physical tags, also known as presentational tags, are used to define the appearance of content on a web page. They describe how the content should be displayed to the user, but they do not provide any information about the meaning or structure of the content. Examples of physical tags in HTML5 include <b>, <i>, <u>, and <font>. While physical tags can be useful for styling content, they are generally considered to be outdated and should be avoided in modern HTML.

    It is recommended to use logical tags whenever possible to create a well-structured and semantically meaningful web page, rather than relying on physical tags for presentation.
